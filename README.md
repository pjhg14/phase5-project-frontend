## This is the frontend for the CareerPad Application

CareerPad in essence is a job search notepad

The mission for CareerPad is not to automatically put your work experiences up to those who might want to hire your services,
For that there are sites like LinkedIn or Indeed or such

The purpose of CareerPad is to provide a single repository of sorts of all your notes while you job search

## Applications
Log all applications including the contacts that potentially have lead you to and interview or otherwise an "in" into a Business
Set when you have submitted your application
If accepted, set when the job starts

## User Info
